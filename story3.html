    <p><h3>Unlike the previous two Insidious films, this movie actually focuses on Elise before the events around the Lambert family. The film opens with a teenage girl named Quinn Brenner visiting a now retired Elise at her home in hopes of connecting with her deceased mother, Lilith. Elise reluctantly agrees, but during the reading, she feels a malicious spirit and warns Quinn to never contact her mother again. We cut to the Brenner’s home with her father Sean getting ready for work, little brother Alex watching television, and Quinn practicing her lines for an audition. Quinn leaves with her brother and meets up with her friend before heading to an audition.</h3></p>
    <p><h3>After bombing her audition, Quinn ends up getting hit by a car and is rushed to the hospital. Right before she awakens, Quinn sees a malicious demon that will end up haunting her for the rest of the film. Once she is back home – now in a wheelchair – the demon continues to haunt Quinn, growing increasingly more violent as the days progress. Meanwhile, Elise reluctantly agrees to help Quinn and when contacting the Lilith comes face to face with the demon. Quinn is attacked by the demon two more times with the first event ending with the teenage girl put in a neck brace.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>Her second encounter has the demon take the form of Lilith and almost pull her from her apartment window. Thankfully, Quinn’s dad witnesses the second attack and reaches out to Elise who agrees to help them. However, Elise explains that she is being hunted by another demon which is the reason Elise was originally retired. She believes that in helping Quinn this other demon will catch and eventually kill her.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>A seance is then held where Elise goes venturing into The Further so she can confront the demon. However, she is attacked in this realm by nonother than the bride in black demon (Parker Crane) and almost killed. Elise goes Carl for help and explains that the bride demon promised to kill her after she stopped the possession of younger Josh in 1986. Back at the home, Specs and Tucker are hired to hunt for the demon by Sean. This ends with Quinn becoming completely possessed by the demon and being knocked out before she can kill herself. Elise arrives after this, hires Specs and Tucker, and performs another seance/exorcism to save Quinn.</h3></p>
    <p><h3>Elise goes back into The Further and is attacked by the bride in black once more, but this time she defeats her. The demon is eventually discovered along with Quinn and Elise does battle to rescue her. However, the demon gains the upper hand, but thanks to Quinn’s deceased mother she is able to defeat the being. Quinn is saved and Elise decides to come out of retirement alongside Tucker and Specs. Insidious: Chapter 3 ends with Elise being visited by the red-faced demon from the first Insidious movie.</h3></p>
