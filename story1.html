    <p><h2>Story begins</h2></p>
    <p><h3><b>Insidious</b> follows the story of the Lambert family who are haunted by a collection of malevolent entities and a powerful demon. The family consists of school teacher Josh, musician Renai, their oldest son Dalton, his younger brother Foster, and baby Cali. Our story opens with the Lambert family moving into a new home and Renai explaining to Dalton that Josh doesn’t like having his photo taken because he’s shy. Later, Dalton investigates some eerie sounds coming from the attic. However, the ladder going up breaks and causes Dalton to fall to the floor.  Dalton’s family rushes to his aid, but everything appears to be fine with the boy.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>The next day Josh goes to wake up his son, only to discover that he is alive but in a comatose state. Insidious‘ story then jumps three months into the future and the Lambert family has set up a medical room to monitor Dalton. Eventually, Renai experiences supernatural events such as a being screamed at through a baby monitor, a bloody handprint on Dalton’s sheet, and a black-haired spirit stalking her.  All of this eventually becomes too much for Renai and she demands that the family moves to a new house.</h3></p>
    <p><h3>Josh agrees and the movie jumps an undisclosed amount of time where we see the Lamberts unpacking in their new home. The viewers are also introduced to Josh’s mother Lorraine, who is seen helping the family get settled. However, the hauntings continue once again with Renai spotting an unknown young boy dancing and running around her home. Lorraine then sits down with the family and tells the Lamberts that she had a  dream about a red-faced demon that explained it wants Dalton.  Realizing that this isn’t going to stop, Lorraine suggests bringing in an expert, Elise Reiner, that she trusts to handle this issue.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>This woman arrives after her assistants – Specs and Tucker – survey the house to determine if the Lamberts have been telling the truth. Elise heads into Dalton’s room where she describes the red-faced demon to Specs who is drawing her vision. She then explains to the family that Dalton is capable of astral projection, which means he can leave his body and explore another realm of existence called “The Further.” While Dalton has visited this place many times before, he was led astray by the demon and became lost. Now, with his body unoccupied both the demon and malevolent spirits seek to take control of his physical shell.</h3></p>
    <p><h3>A seance is conducted that ends with the spirits attacking and the demon briefly caught on tape by Tucker. The family and Elise go back downstairs and reveal that Josh can actually astral-project like Dalton.  It turns out that Josh was haunted by a vicious spirit that took the form of an old woman in a black bridal gown when he was a child. The ghost would appear closer in photographs taken of Josh, which explains why he is uncomfortable being in pictures as an adult. Elise was able to temporarily banish the spirit and wiped Josh’s memory so he couldn’t astral project.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>Because this ability is still within Josh, he decides to meditate and venture out into The Further in search of Dalton. After some time Josh finds his son locked in a room with the demon and frees him from his shackles. The demon chases Josh and Dalton back to The Further version of their home, guided by the voice of Renai pleading for the duo to come back. Right before they escape, Josh is confronted by the spirit of the old woman and tells her that he’s no longer afraid of her. She laughs and vanishes just both Josh and Dalton wake up from their sleep. The family is reunited and Dalton is finally safe from the red-faced demon.</h3></p>
    <p><h3>However, Elise feels that something is wrong with Josh and takes his photo which sends him into a rage. Josh chokes and kills Elise while everyone is distracted, leaving no evidence that he was the one to murder her. Renai discovers the body and photo where it’s revealed to the audience that the old woman was captured in the photo where Josh was standing. This means that Josh didn’t vanquish his own spirit and she took possession of his body. The movie ends with “Josh” standing behind Renai and her gasping.</h3></p>
