    <p><h2>Story begins...</h2></p>
    <p><h3>Insidious: Chapter II takes place all across the timeline for the Insidious series so it can be a bit tricky to follow right away. The film opens in 1986 when a young Elise arrives at the Lambert home to help a young Josh deal with the spirit of an old woman that is haunting him. She is successful, but we do see Josh talking to what appears to be no-one on camera. Jumping forward in time, Renai explains to the police how Elise died. No one believes that it was the work of a ghost and leave the case open since there is no evidence that pins Josh as the perpetrator. While Renai heavily suspects that Josh is possessed by the spirit of the old woman, she has no proof outside of the photo found at the end of the first Insidious.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>The next day Renai is attacked by the spirit of a woman in a white dress, who knocks her unconscious on the floor. Meanwhile, Lorraine visits Specs and Tucker to discuss what happened to Elise which leads to them watching a tape of younger Josh’s seance. It’s then revealed that when the contrast of the footage is raised, younger Josh was actually speaking to our present-day version of Josh. Another paranormal expert, Carl, is called in and they attempt to contact the spirit of Elise. They succeed and she tells them to go to the “Our Lady of Angels” hospital which is where Lorraine used to work. Naturally, the group goes to the hospital and encounter a plethora of different supernatural occurrences.</h3></p>
    <p><h3>Before they leave, the trio finds out that the old woman was actually a mentally deranged man called Parker Crane. He would take the form of a bride in a black wedding outfit and murdered 15 different people when he was alive. They also discover that the spirit they were communicating with was not actually Elise, but Parker’s mother. Renai eventually awakens and speaks with Lorraine who explains the theory that Parker Crane has taken possession of Josh’s body. Tucker, Specs, and Carl attempt to drug Josh but the plan fails and Josh renders everyone unconscious.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>Here’s where things get a bit more complicated. We cut to The Further and learn that the real Josh has been trapped there ever since the end of the first Insidious. Carl – who assumes he is dead – meets up with Josh and the two go looking for Elise. Eventually, they stumble upon The Further’s version of the Lambert’s first house in the original Insidious. It’s never outwardly explained, but time plays out differently in this realm and Josh’s actions in The Further directly affected some of the events in the first movie. This plays out as Chapter 2’s Josh kicks open the door that sets off the house alarm that was originally assumed to be the work of a spirit in Insidious. Josh gets into a fight with a spirit from the first Insidious but is saved by Elise who came to help them.</h3></p>
    <p><h3>Renai and Lorraine return to their home and are attacked by the Parker Crane possessed Josh.  Lorraine is locked in a closet and Renai is almost killed. Saved by her children, she rushes to the basement and locks herself there so Crane can’t reach her. In The Further, Josh Elise, and Carl go visit the younger version of Josh back in 1986 and speak to him. This mimics the footage we see earlier in the film and explains why older Josh was captured on video during younger Josh’s seance. Young Josh leads them to where they need to go and the group discovers the home of Parker Crane. Here it’s revealed that Crane’s mother was abusive and forced him to dress and act like a girl. Crane’s mother spots the group and lets out a screech that separates them.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>In normal reality, Crane uses a fire extinguisher and attempts to break down the basement doors to get to Renai and her children. Dalton decides to go into The Further to help save his father and Specs wakes up. Speces goes and saves Lorraine in the closet just as Parker breaks through the door. Back in The Further Josh fights with Crane’s mother, who is eventually killed by Elise. This causes Crane to leave Josh’s body, Dalton to wake up, and Carl (who wasn’t actually dead) to come back. The family is reunited with Josh and Dalton’s memory of The Further is wiped by Carl the next day. Specs and Tucker continue investigating spirits with the help of Elise from The Further. Insidious: Chapter 2 ends with Elise speaking with a young girl, but stopping when she hears an odd creaking noise in the background. Staring into the darkness, Elise’s eyes go wide and she says “Oh my god” before the movie cuts to the credits.</h3></p>
